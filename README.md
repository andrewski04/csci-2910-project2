# Hello 
## My networking ninjas

To get started install nodejs and run `npm install` inside the project directory. (`git clone` this directory)
This will install all the dependencies and setup the environment for this to run.

To run the code run `npm run dev` inside the project directory. This will automatically compile and run the code whenever a change is made.

This project uses typescript, which is a superset of javascript that uses a strict type system, which allows you to do cool stuff like hover over an object to see its attributes and detect errors in the code before it runs. Once you understand the basics, it should seem pretty intuitive coming from C#.
